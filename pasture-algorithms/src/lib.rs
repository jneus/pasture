// Algorithm to calculate the convex hull of a point cloud.
pub mod convexhull;
// Contains ransac line- and plane-segmentation algorithms in serial and parallel that can be used
// to get the best line-/plane-model and the corresponding inlier indices.
pub mod segmentation;
// Contains an algorithm to reproject coordinate systems
pub mod reprojection;
// Contains voxel-grid-filter function to downsample a given point buffer.
pub mod voxel_grid;
// Contains a normal estimation algorithm that can be used to determine the orientation of the surface
// over a point and its k nearest neighbors. The algorithm also determine the curvature of the surface
